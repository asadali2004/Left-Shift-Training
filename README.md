## 📘 Left Shift .NET Full Stack Training — Day-wise Learning

This repository documents my **day-wise learning, assignments, and use-case implementations** from the **Left Shift .NET Full Stack Training Program (2025–26)**.

The training follows a **structured, industry-aligned curriculum**, combining core backend development, full-stack concepts, testing, databases, frontend technologies, and sprint-based implementation, along with regular revisions and power-skill sessions.

### 📂 Folder Naming Convention

- Day folders use a zero-padded format for proper ordering on GitHub: `DAY01_...`, `DAY02_...`, ..., `DAY12_...`.
- When creating new day folders, follow: `DAYNN_<Topic>` where `NN` is two digits (e.g., `DAY13_Async_Programming`).
- Non-day folders (e.g., `Practice_Questions`, `Scenario_Based_Solutions`) remain unchanged.
